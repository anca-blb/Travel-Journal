# About

[Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontendReact) Solo Project 

Requirements :

- create a travel journal following the style requirements of this [Figma design file.](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1)

- create a data array with information about each place from your travel journal to mimic real data flow

## Notes

In addition to the requirements I made my journal responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop. I also added a badge that conditionally renders a text for places that I have visited and the places I want to visit.

## What I have learned

* Props is a special keywors in React which stands for properties. We use props to pass data from one component to another.

* Mapping data using map() method.
